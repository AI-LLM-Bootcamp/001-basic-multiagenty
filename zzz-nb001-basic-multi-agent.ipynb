    "1. **Function Definition (`create_new_agent`)**:\n",
    "   - It takes four parameters:\n",
    "     - `llm`: an instance of `ChatOpenAI`, which refers to the language model from OpenAI.\n",
    "     - `tools`: a list of tools that the agent can use.\n",
    "     - `system_prompt`: a string that provides an initial message or command for the agent.\n",
    "   - The function is expected to return an instance of `AgentExecutor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Prompt**:\n",
    "   - `prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([...])`: This line constructs a prompt for the agent using a template. The prompt includes:\n",
    "     - A system message (`system_prompt`).\n",
    "     - Two placeholders for additional dynamic content, labeled `\"messages\"` and `\"agent_scratchpad\"`. These are used to insert messages that the agent receives during its operation and notes or data that the agent might need to keep track of, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating an Agent**:\n",
    "   - `agent = create_openai_tools_agent(llm, tools, prompt)`: This line initializes the agent using the language model (`llm`), the list of tools (`tools`), and the prompt created earlier. The function (`create_openai_tools_agent`) is designed to configure the agent with the necessary components to function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating an Executor**:\n",
    "   - `executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)`: This creates an `AgentExecutor` object, which manages the execution of the agent's tasks. It is configured with the agent itself and the tools the agent can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Executor**:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Return Value (`return {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=result[\"output\"], name=name)]}`):**\n",

    "   - The value associated with this key is a list containing a single instance of `HumanMessage`.\n",

    "#### What does functools.partial do?\n",
    "The `functools` module is part of the Python standard library and **doesn't need to be installed separately.**\n",
    "\n",
    "`functools` provides tools that help you modify and manage functions easily. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of some of its main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`partial`**: Imagine you have a recipe that you always cook with a slight variation. Instead of rewriting the recipe each time, you can write down the common steps and just specify the variation when needed. `partial` helps you create a simplified version of a function by pre-setting some arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`lru_cache`**: This is like having a small notebook where you write down solutions to problems you've already solved. The next time you face the same problem, instead of solving it again, you just look at your notebook. This saves time, especially for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`reduce`**: Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to combine them into one number, maybe by adding them up. `reduce` takes a function (like addition) and a list, applies the function to combine the items of the list into a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`total_ordering`**: If you have a class representing people with just their ages and you want to easily compare who is older or younger, you usually need to write several methods to compare them. With `total_ordering`, you just write one comparison method, and it figures out the rest for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`singledispatch`**: This lets you write a general function that can behave differently depending on what type of thing it is dealing with. For example, you might have a function that needs to handle both numbers and strings differently with just one function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`cmp_to_key`**: Some tools in Python sort objects but need a special rule for how to rank them. `cmp_to_key` converts an old-style comparison function (which tells you which of two values is larger) into a key function that the sorting tool can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, `functools` helps make functions more versatile and easier to manage in your programs."

It is expected to hold a sequence (like a list or a tuple) of items, each of which is an instance of `BaseMessage`. `BaseMessage` is a Base class in LangChain for all types of messages in a conversation. It includes properties like `content`, `name`, and `additional_kwargs`. It also includes methods like `toDict()` and `_getType()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]`**: Here, `Annotated` is used to add additional information to the type hint. This extra information is `operator.add`, suggesting that the values in the `messages` sequence might be combined using the addition operation, indicating that messages can be concatenated or aggregated. The `operator` module in Python provides a set of functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python. For example, instead of using + for addition, operator.add(x, y) can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`next`**: This is another key in the `AgentState` dictionary. It holds a value of type `str`, which means it's expected to be a string. This could be used to indicate the next action, state, or identifier in a process or workflow involving an \"agent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `AgentState` class defines a template for creating dictionaries that keep track of an agent's messages and its next state or action. Each `AgentState` dictionary will have a list of `messages` that are instances of `BaseMessage` and a `next` value that is a string. The use of `Annotated` with `operator.add` might imply some special handling or processing of the messages that isn't standard in typical type hints."
